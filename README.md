# Chat App with Socket.io

#### (in development)

### Description

Chat App with Socket.io is a dynamic, real-time messaging platform designed to facilitate seamless communication and collaboration. Built using modern web technologies, it supports live chat functionality and user interactions in various chat rooms.

### Features

1. Real-Time Messaging:
   
- Uses Socket.io for real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
- Messages are instantly broadcasted to all users in the same chat room.

2. User Authentication:

- Express.js handles user authentication with jsonwebtoken for secure token-based sessions.
- Users can log in and see their username displayed in the chat interface.
- On logout, user tokens are cleared, and feedback messages are provided.
  
3. Room Management:
   
- Users can join different chat rooms and send messages within them.
- The application supports multiple rooms with real-time updates and notifications.
  
<!-- 4. Typing Indicators:
   
- The application shows typing indicators to let users know when someone is typing a message. -->
  
4. Feedback System:
   
- Provides visual feedback for various actions (e.g., joining a room, sending a message, or logging out).
  

### Technologies used


- **JavaScript**
- **React**: For building the user interface, managing state, and handling component lifecycle.
- **Vite**:  For fast development and build tooling.
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the application.
- **Express.js**:  For server-side logic and API handling.
- **Socket.io**: For real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and server.
- **Bcrypt**: For hashing passwords.
- **MySQL**: For database management.
- **ViteProxy**: To avoid CORS issues entirely during development by making it seem like the frontend and backend are served from the same origin.
- **CORS**: For production ensures that only allowed origins can access your API.
- **jsonwebtoken**: For managing user authentication tokens.
- **git**: For version control.

### Instalation

To install dependencies for both the client and server, run the following command in the respective root directories:

```bash
npm install
```
### Add .env file in client folder looking like:

```
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3000

```
This is the server that your frontend will connect to for WebSocket communication or other similar server-side interactions.

### Add .env file in server folder looking like:

```
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

# CORS Configuration
CORS_ORIGIN_DEV=http://localhost:5173
CORS_ORIGIN_PROD=your_production_domain

# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name

```
PORT=3000:

This specifies the port number on which your backend server will run. 

NODE_ENV=development:

This environment variable is used to indicate the environment in which your Node.js application is running. Common values include development, production, and test.

JWT_SECRET:

This is the secret key used to sign and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWTs are used for authentication and secure communication between the client and server.
Itâ€™s crucial that this key is kept secure and not shared, as it is the cornerstone of your token's security. In a production environment, this key should be more complex and stored securely.

CORS_ORIGIN_DEV:

This setting specifies which origins (i.e., which domains/ports) are allowed to make requests to your server during development.
Since your frontend is running on http://localhost:5173, this value allows requests from that origin to interact with your backend at http://localhost:3000.
CORS_ORIGIN_PROD:
This setting is for the production environment, you would typically set this to the actual domain name where your frontend is hosted (e.g., https://yourdomain.com).

DB_HOST:

This specifies the hostname or IP address of the database server. In this case, localhost indicates that the database is running on the same machine as your backend server. In a production environment, this might point to a remote database server.

DB_USER:

This is the username used to connect to the database. Typically set up during the installation of MySQL.

DB_PASSWORD:

This is the password for the database user specified in DB_USER.
You are usually prompted to set a password for the user during installation. 

DB_NAME:

This specifies the name of the database that your application will connect to,
means that your application will connect to the your_database_name database using the your_username account.



### Run the application


1. Start the Client (Front-End)

Navigate to the client directory and start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev

```
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173 (or whichever port is specified by Vite).

2. Start the Server (Back-End)
   
   Start the server by navigating to the *server* directory and running:

```bash
npm start

```

### Known Issues

- Socket Connection Errors: There might be issues with WebSocket connections or configurations, leading to interruptions.
